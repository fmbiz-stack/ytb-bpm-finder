"""BO2 emblem .bin parser + renderer.

Format confirmed against github.com/olie304/CallOfDutyEmblemSpecs and then
validated end-to-end against the live BO2 PC game engine itself (writing
emblems into the editor's memory buffer and comparing the game's own preview
render to ours - see the geometry note in render_png; a full 31-layer test
emblem matches the game at ~0.95 registered pixel correlation):
  - Body is a 1408-byte blob (strip the HTTP response headers first).
  - 32 fixed layer records, 44 bytes each.
  - Byte order is whatever the console that wrote it uses - big-endian from a
    PS3, little-endian from PC and the PS4/PS5 ports - so it's detected per
    blob rather than assumed (see detect_endianness).
  - Each layer: uint16 shapeId, 2 bytes padding, then 9 float32
        (R, G, B, A, posX, posY, scaleX, scaleY, rotation),
    then outlined(byte, bool), flipped(byte, bool), 2 bytes padding.
    * shapeId 65535 (0xFFFF) = empty/unused layer
    * R,G,B,A in 0..1
    * posX,posY: fraction of the box half-extent from center; +Y is DOWN.
      pos 0.5 reaches the box edge (offset in px == pos * output size).
    * true scale = 2**scaleX/Y (always positive; NOT a linear multiplier).
      scale 0 (2**0=1) fills the whole box.
    * mirroring is the separate `flipped` bool, not the sign of scale
    * rotation in degrees (0..360), clockwise-positive
    * outlined(bool): draw only a thin edge stroke instead of a filled glyph
    * layer index: LOWER index renders further back, higher index in front

Rendering: for shape IDs confirmed in shape_id_map.known_ids, composites the
real shape glyph (reference_shapes/<name>.png, a white/alpha LA image) tinted
with the layer's actual color - this is a pixel-accurate render matching the
game. For unconfirmed IDs (none remain in the current map), falls back to a
schematic colored rounded-rect so the palette/composition still shows.
